# Meta Ads Automation Module

**Status: built and active.**

## 1. What It Is

Meta Ads automates the whole lifecycle of a Meta (Facebook/Instagram) advertising campaign: an AI generates the video or image creative, and a wizard launches it as a real (paused) Campaign → Ad Set → Ad on the Meta Graph API. (A weekly self-ad-analysis job and an earlier competitor-analysis job both used to feed AI-generated "market intelligence" into ad-generation prompts — the self-ad-analysis job scored live ad performance into next-cycle creative directives, and the competitor-analysis job scraped the Facebook Ads Library — but both jobs, their Dashboard/Settings surfaces, and every prompt section that read their output were removed as an unused feature. Ad generation today is grounded purely in the business's own Settings context and the user's own idea/brief, nothing else.)

## 2. Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Ad Creative Generation** | One prompt in (e.g. "Summer sale for dental implants") → AI writes the copy/visual prompts and generates the final video or image, via a background Inngest job (script → visual prompting → voiceover → image/video generation → final FFmpeg assembly). |
| **Campaign Launch** | A 3-step wizard always creates a brand-new Campaign → Ad Set → Ad hierarchy, **paused**, directly on the Meta Graph API — never a mock. |
| **Add Ad Set** | Adds another audience under an *existing* campaign, inheriting its objective and CBO status. |
| **Add Creative (Ad)** | Adds another Ad under an *existing* Ad Set, inheriting its targeting/budget/optimization goal. |
| **Quick Edit / Undo** | Ad copy can be edited after generation; every prior version is kept (`meta_ad_creatives.revision_history`) so a bad edit isn't a dead end. |
| **Performance Polling** | Daily sync of every ad's live spend/impressions/clicks into `ad_performance_daily` — the input to the Dashboard's spend trend and self-ad score chart. |
| **Lead Capture** | No webhook, and no live Meta call on page load either — a background job syncs into our own `leads` table every 5 minutes (Meta itself purges leads after 90 days, so this is the permanent copy). A manual "Sync now" button forces an immediate check. |
| **Instant Forms management** | Create/view/archive Meta Lead Gen forms directly from Kinetix. |

## 3. Pages

| Page | Route | What you can do there |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/meta-ads` | KPIs (spend, CTR, ads tracked), spend trend, self-ad score distribution — date-range selector (7d/14d/30d/90d/All). |
| Campaigns | `/meta-ads/campaigns` | Every campaign as a card (ad set/ad counts, age), paginated; "New Campaign" launches the wizard. |
| Campaign Detail | `/meta-ads/campaigns/:campaignId` | Every Meta field for the campaign, lifetime performance, its Ad Sets, and "+ Add Ad Set". |
| Ad Set Detail | `/meta-ads/campaigns/:campaignId/:adSetId` | Targeting/placements/budget/optimization detail, lifetime performance, its Ads, and "+ Add Creative". |
| Ad Detail | `/meta-ads/campaigns/:campaignId/:adSetId/:adId` | Creative preview, full ad copy, lifetime performance, "Preview on Meta," and inline copy editing. |
| Reports | `/meta-ads/reports` | Live ad-level performance table (spend/CTR/CPM/score) for a selected range, paginated. |
| Ad Library | `/meta-ads/ad-library` | Every generated/uploaded creative as a dense thumbnail grid, paginated; approve, retry, delete, or launch/relaunch a campaign from one. |
| Leads | `/meta-ads/leads` | Browse captured leads (paginated table, synced from Meta every 5 minutes in the background) or manage Instant Forms, on two tabs; "Sync now" forces an immediate check. |
| Create Campaign | `/meta-ads/campaigns/create` | The 3-step Launch wizard (reached from Campaigns or Ad Library, not in the sidebar). |

### 3.1 Campaign Launch & Management Flow, in more detail

Three distinct entry points, each with exactly one job — deliberately not one omnibus "Launch" flow that also handles appending to something that already exists:

1. **The Launch wizard** (Campaigns page "New Campaign," or Ad Library's per-creative "Launch"/"Relaunch") — always creates a brand-new Campaign + its first Ad Set + first Ad. 3 steps: **Campaign** (name, objective, optional CBO toggle — when on, the daily/lifetime budget is asked here instead of step 2), **Ad Set** (Optimization Goal filtered by objective, countries/age/gender, Advantage+ Audience toggle, Placements — Advantage+ automatic or manual Facebook/Instagram platform+position picker — budget if not CBO, optional schedule), **Creative** (pick an approved creative, ad copy, Instant Form picker if objective is Leads). `POST /api/meta-ads/campaigns/launch`.
2. **"+ Add Ad Set"** (Campaign Detail page) — adds another audience under that campaign, inheriting its objective and CBO status from our own `campaigns` row (never re-derived from Meta). Can use a Daily or Lifetime budget. `POST /api/meta-ads/campaigns/[campaignId]/ad-sets`.
3. **"+ Add Creative"** (Ad Set Detail page) — adds another Ad under that Ad Set, inheriting its targeting/budget/optimization goal untouched. If the Ad Set's `optimization_goal` is `LEAD_GENERATION`, a Lead Gen Form is required instead of a destination URL (Meta doesn't allow mixing lead-form ads and website-link ads in the same ad set). `POST /api/meta-ads/campaigns/ad-sets/[adSetId]/ads`.

All three follow the same underlying sequence (shared helpers in `launch.service.ts`): upload the creative's media (`meta_ad_creatives.media_urls`, not `media_assets`/`media_asset_id`) + resolve the Facebook Page in parallel → resolve delivery settings (optimization goal, and a Pixel auto-discovered/created if the goal needs one) → create the Ad Set on Meta → create the Ad Creative → create the Ad → persist our own pointer row(s) with the Meta-assigned `external_*_id`s. **Every object created this way is `status: "PAUSED"` — going live is always a separate, explicit action** (Smart Run, or the generic pause/resume/archive endpoint), never automatic.

Manual placement choices are genuinely sent to Meta (`publisher_platforms`/`facebook_positions`/`instagram_positions`) when "Manual" is chosen — unlike the legacy project, whose equivalent UI collected these but never actually forwarded them.

### Credentials — env vars, not `platform_connections`

Both Launch and the nightly sync job read `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`/`META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID` directly via `requireMetaAdAccountEnv()` in `src/services/meta/graph-client.ts` — this module does not read from `platform_connections`/Vault at all today. Lead Capture uses a *separate* pair of credentials (`META_PAGE_ID`/`META_PAGE_TOKEN`) — Page scope, not ad-account scope. See `CLAUDE.md`'s Meta Ads section.

### Lead Capture — live on every page load, not a webhook and not a background sync

`GET /api/meta-ads/leads` calls `LeadsService.syncFromMeta()` (walks every Instant Form's leads via the Graph API, upserts them on `meta_lead_id`) before reading the `leads` table on every request — a real, measured 7-8 second round trip on each page load, accepted by deliberate choice so the page never shows data older than "right now." This used to go through a 5-minute background cron (`jobs/meta-ads-leads-sync.job.ts`) instead, with the route only ever reading the table; that job was removed in favor of always-live data — see `../architecture/system_design.md`'s note on Leads/dashboards calling their APIs live. Because `syncFromMeta()` only upserts and never deletes, a lead from an earlier sync stays in `leads` even if a later Graph API response happens to omit it, so reading the table right after syncing already reflects everything ever seen, not just this one call's response. If the live sync itself fails, the route falls back to whatever's already in `leads` instead of failing the whole page. A "Sync now" button (`POST /api/meta-ads/leads/sync`, same underlying service) still exists for forcing another sync without leaving/reloading the page. There's deliberately no real-time webhook either — that would need a stable public URL, HMAC signature verification, and a one-time dashboard subscription, none of which is worth the complexity for a single-tenant app.

## 4. Pagination

Campaigns, Reports, Ad Library, and Leads all paginate server-side through the shared system described in `../architecture/system_design.md` §6 — Campaigns/Reports/Leads at `PAGE_SIZE_COMPACT` (10), Ad Library at `PAGE_SIZE_DENSE` (20, denser thumbnail grid). Reports has no DB table backing its list (see §5 below) — its pagination is a post-fetch slice of the already-fully-fetched, already-sorted in-memory array, with the summary/KPI row always computed over the full range regardless of which page is showing.

## 5. Database Relationships

- `meta_ad_creatives`: the AI-generated copy (`ad_script`) and a link to the final video/image via `media_asset_id` (`media_assets`), plus `revision_history` for Quick-Edit/undo.
- `ad_performance_daily`: real Meta ad performance, synced daily — powers the Dashboard's spend trend and self-ad score chart, computed fresh on every load (`src/services/ai/self-ad-processor.ts`).
- `campaigns`, `ad_sets`, `ads`: mirror Meta's own object structure, each a pointer (`external_*_id`) to the real Meta object — see §3.1 above. **Fully built**, not schema-only.
- `leads`: permanent lead storage, synced live from Meta on every Leads-page load.

See `../architecture/database_schema.md` for the full table list — this doc only covers what's specific to Meta Ads. Reports' ad-level list has **no backing DB table at all** — it's entirely live Meta Graph Insights data, by design (see §6 below), so don't go looking for a "reports" table.

## 6. Why It's Built This Way

- **Reports never touches `ad_performance_daily`.** That table exists purely for the nightly sync job / Dashboard trend charts. Reports needs "today" to never be stale, so it always calls the Graph API live for whatever range is selected — trading a slightly slower request for a guarantee that the numbers are never a snapshot.
- **Everything Launch creates starts `PAUSED`.** Going live is always a separate, explicit action (Smart Run / Resume) — never a side effect of creating something, so a half-configured campaign can never accidentally start spending.

## 7. Known Limitations

- Ad Creative Generation has no caption/subtitle-burning step in the pipeline yet (Social Media's video pipeline has this via AssemblyAI; Meta Ads' doesn't).
- No settings screen field ties directly to Meta Ads beyond the "Advantage+ Audience by default" toggle and the shared video character reference — most targeting/budget defaults are chosen fresh in the Launch wizard each time, not stored as a reusable template.
- Reports' pagination is a slice of an already-fully-fetched account-wide list (see §4) — very large accounts (\>500 ads/insights rows, the `graphGetAllPages` cap) would see a truncated set rather than true deep pagination.
