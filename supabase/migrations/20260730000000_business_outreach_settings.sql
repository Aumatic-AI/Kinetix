-- Business-level outreach sending defaults (schedule/timezone/daily limit) —
-- currently hardcoded in src/services/instantly/client.ts (the campaign
-- schedule passed to Instantly on creation) and the campaign create route's
-- daily_limit fallback. This makes them per-business and DB-backed so a
-- future Settings page can edit them without a code change. No settings UI
-- yet — this migration only adds the storage; the app still reads sensible
-- hardcoded defaults today unless/until wired up.

-- Services gain an optional description alongside the name — several
-- AI-facing features only ever saw the bare service name (e.g. "Dental
-- Treatment"); a description lets the business explain what that actually
-- means for them, giving the AI real grounding instead of guessing from the
-- name alone. Converts the existing TEXT[] into a JSONB array of
-- {name, description} objects, preserving whatever names already exist.
-- description is optional (nullable) — nothing requires backfilling it.
