  // image+video+narration generation), never the normal case.
  //
  // There used to also be a word-budget trim here that dropped trailing
  // lines whenever the estimated spoken length exceeded a fixed
  // "scriptLines x 4 seconds" budget — a holdover from before each scene's
  // clip was sized to its OWN measured narration length (see
  // generate-social-video.ts step 4/7, clamped 4-12s per scene, not a
  // uniform 4s). That stale check triggered often on Social's more
  // conversational, unhurried phrasing, silently shrinking a well-formed
  // script down toward its 3-line floor and producing a much shorter final
  // video than requested. Removed for the same reason it was removed from
  // Meta Ads' generateVideoScript (video-script.ts) — see that file's
  // comment for the full rationale.
