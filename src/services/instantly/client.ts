 * shared Instantly campaign for every Kinetix campaign, reusing the same
 * pre-built sequence for everything — the root cause of several legacy
 * bugs), every Kinetix outreach campaign gets its own dedicated Instantly
 * campaign, with its own sequence pushed at creation time from that
 * campaign's own generated_subject/generated_body. The schedule/days shape
 * and the {{firstName}}/{{companyName}} merge-tag names are per Instantly's
 * public v2 docs — not yet exercised against a real send, so if Instantly
 * rejects the request or the tags don't merge, check the error body
 * (included in the thrown error) and adjust this shape first.
