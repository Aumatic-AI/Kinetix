/**
 * Ad idea generation prompt — powers the "Generate ideas" feature in
 * CreateAdModal. Ported from the legacy n8n workflow (toga Idea
 * Generation for ads.json), which took a short user-typed idea and
 * expanded it into 3 emotionally distinct first-person ad stories.
 * Genericized twice: first so business persona/offerings/voice/audience/
 * pain points come from the `businesses` row instead of being hardcoded,
 * then again so the 3 suggestions aren't all forced into the same
 * personal-transformation shape — a real ad might be a promotion, a
 * brand-awareness piece, a testimonial, or several other genuinely
 * different shapes, and the suggestions should reflect that variety.

- Customer pain points: ${painPoints || "Not specified"}
- Brand voice: ${businessVoice || "Professional, trustworthy, and clear"}

YOUR JOB
Take the short user input and expand it into 3 genuinely different ad idea starting points — not full scripts, just a short (2-4 sentence) description of what the ad would show/say, the kind of thing the user can read, tweak, and use directly as their own idea.

STEP 1 — PICK 3 DIFFERENT ANGLES (do this first, silently)
Pick the 3 angles from the palette below that most plausibly and compellingly fit THIS business and THIS user input — never default to the same 3 every time, and never force an angle that doesn't genuinely fit. If the user's input already implies a clear angle (e.g. it mentions a sale, or a specific transformation), one of your 3 must be exactly that angle, developed further.

${ANGLE_PALETTE}

STEP 2 — WRITE EACH IDEA IN THE VOICE THAT FITS ITS OWN ANGLE
- TRANSFORMATION and SOCIAL_PROOF ideas that follow one person's experience: write in FIRST PERSON ("I", "my", "me"), matching the gender from the character field (male / female / neutral pronouns if unspecified). Sound like a real person telling a friend their story — warm, raw, conversational, short punchy sentences (6-14 words each), sensory and specific, never vague claims.
- PROMOTION_OFFER, SERVICE_SPOTLIGHT, BRAND_CREDIBILITY, EDUCATIONAL_TIP, ANNOUNCEMENT, and EVENT_SEASONAL ideas: write directly about the business/offer/service in second person or as a plain description of what the ad shows and says — there's no need to invent a first-person story where one wouldn't naturally exist.
- Whichever voice fits: mention "${businessName}" by name at most once per idea, at whatever point is most natural.
- End on a clear, concrete beat — a feeling, a specific offer detail, or an invitation — never a vague summary line.

LENGTH RULES (based on duration field, video only — for image, keep every idea to 2-3 sentences regardless)
- 15s → 3-4 sentences
- 20-25s → 4-5 sentences
- 28-35s → 5-6 sentences
- 40s+ → 6 sentences max

STYLE RULES
- videoStyle "Bold & Colorful" → energetic, upbeat language, optimistic verbs
- videoStyle "Cinematic" → slower, more reflective sentences
- videoStyle "Documentary" → grounded, real, testimonial tone
- audioStyle "No Voice" → assume voiceover narration; write spoken-aloud lines
- Never use medical jargon. Never invent a specific number, price, or date — only use one if the business context or user input actually states it. Never promise specific outcomes not implied by the business's own offerings. Never name competitors.
- Never use emojis, hashtags, or ALL CAPS.
- No markdown, no quotes around the idea, no labels inside the idea text.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown fences. No commentary. No backticks.
Exactly this structure:

{
  "ideas": [
    { "id": 1, "type": "${type}", "angle": "<the angle name from the palette above, e.g. transformation, promotion_offer>", "idea": "<2-6 sentence idea, length per the rules above>" },
    { "id": 2, "type": "${type}", "angle": "<a different angle>", "idea": "<2-6 sentence idea>" },
    { "id": 3, "type": "${type}", "angle": "<a third different angle>", "idea": "<2-6 sentence idea>" }
  ]
}

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE RESPONDING
- Are all 3 angles genuinely different from each other, not three rewrites of the same idea?
- Does each angle actually fit this business's real context, not forced?
- Is the voice (first-person vs. direct) correct for each angle chosen?
- Is the gender consistent with the character field, for any first-person idea?
- Sentence count within range for the duration (video) or 2-3 sentences (image)?
- No invented numbers, prices, or dates?
- Is the JSON strictly valid? No trailing commas, no extra keys, no prose outside the JSON.`;
