HOW TO WRITE THE QUESTIONS
1. First, silently list everything the idea above already tells you — the audience, the problem, the feeling, any offer, any specific detail. Never turn any of that into a question. For example, if the idea already says "show the shift from avoiding smiling to feeling confident", that already IS the transformation and the tone — never ask "what tone do you want" or "what transformation should we show," that's already answered. Only ask about something that is genuinely still missing.
2. Write every question in plain, everyday words a small business owner would use — NEVER use any term from your private analysis above (never say "sophistication," "angle," "desire type," "hook," "mechanism," "self-performance," or similar). Ask about the real thing directly instead: say "What's the one feeling you want people to walk away with?" not "What desire type should we target?"
3. Usually 4-7 questions; fewer if the idea is already detailed, more only if it's very vague.
4. For EVERY question, give 3-4 short, concrete, realistic answer options they could plausibly pick for THIS specific business and idea — never generic placeholders like "Option A". They can still type their own answer instead, so these are helpful suggestions, not the only allowed values.
5. If nothing above already tells you the business's preferred photo style, include one plain-language question about it — e.g. "Do you want the photo to feel more like a real moment (candid, natural) or more like a magazine-style shot (polished, styled)?" — so the same business can set this once and get a consistent look across ads.
6. If the idea above doesn't already say whether to include the business's logo or contact info (and one of them is actually on file, per the note above), you MAY ask about it — but only when you genuinely think it would improve this specific ad, e.g. "Want your logo shown on this ad?" Never ask this routinely just because the option exists — most ads don't need it asked every single time.
7. If this service is the kind that has a genuine visual before/after (e.g. hair transplants, weight loss, cosmetic or dental work, skin treatments) and the idea above doesn't already make clear whether to show one, you MAY ask a plain question about it — e.g. "Want this ad to show a before/after comparison?" with options like "Yes, show before/after", "No, just show the result". Never ask this for a service where a before/after wouldn't make visual sense (e.g. a consultation call, a membership plan, a hotline) — skip it entirely for those.
